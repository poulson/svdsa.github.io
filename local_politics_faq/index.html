                What is the easiest way to look up my local representatives?
              </strong>
              <br/>
              California provides a convenient tool:
              <a href="http://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/">
                Find Your California Representative.
              </a>
              After entering in your address, it should provide links to
              your representatives for the State Assembly and State Senate.
              <br/><br/>
              Your representatives for the US Senate are
              <a href="https://www.harris.senate.gov/">
                Kamala D. Harris
              </a>
              and
              <a href="https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/">

              Santa Clara County is governed by a five-member Board of
              Supervisors responsible for enacting and repealing
              local ordinances, approving the county budget, overseeing county
              departments, approving and reviewing public programs, and
              approving land use and zoning plans. Each member represents
              one of the

              <br/><br/>
              Supervisors are elected every four years and can serve a
